# Instructions

## How to run
1. Clone this repo in your working directory.
2. Run `make all`
3. Add your .c source file that includes main (we'll call it main.c). Don't forget to include "libftprintf.a" in it to use `ft_printf`.
4. Run `cc main.c libftprintf.a -o my_program`
5. Run `./my_program`
## Cleanup
After compiling the library, you can run
1. `make clean` to delete all .o files created previously (This keeps libftprintf.a)
2. `make fclean` to delete all .o files created previously and libftprintf.a
3. `make re` as a shortcut for "make fclean" followed by "make all"
